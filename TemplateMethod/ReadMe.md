**The Template Method Pattern**
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

**Example: Coffee and Tea Preparation**
We'll create a system to prepare different types of beverages (coffee and tea). The preparation process will be the same for both, but some steps will differ.

**Step 1: Define the Abstract Class**
The abstract class defines the template method and declares abstract methods that subclasses must implement.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class CaffeineBeverage(ABC):
    def prepare_recipe(self):
        """Template method that defines the algorithm skeleton."""
        self.boil_water()
        self.brew()
        self.pour_in_cup()
        self.add_condiments()

    def boil_water(self):
        print("Boiling water")

    def pour_in_cup(self):
        print("Pouring into cup")

    @abstractmethod
    def brew(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def add_condiments(self):
        pass
```

**Step 2: Implement Concrete Classes**
Concrete classes implement the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.

```python
class Tea(CaffeineBeverage):
    def brew(self):
        print("Steeping the tea")

    def add_condiments(self):
        print("Adding lemon")

class Coffee(CaffeineBeverage):
    def brew(self):
        print("Dripping coffee through filter")

    def add_condiments(self):
        print("Adding sugar and milk")
```

**Step 3: Using the Template Method Pattern**
We create instances of `Tea` and `Coffee` and call the `prepare_recipe` method.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Making tea...")
    tea = Tea()
    tea.prepare_recipe()

    print("\nMaking coffee...")
    coffee = Coffee()
    coffee.prepare_recipe()
```

**Explanation**

**Abstract Class (CaffeineBeverage):**

- Defines the `prepare_recipe` method, which is the template method.
- Implements the steps that are common to all subclasses (boil_water and pour_in_cup).
- Declares abstract methods (brew and add_condiments) that subclasses must implement.

**Concrete Classes (Tea and Coffee):**

- Implement the abstract methods to define the specific behavior for brewing and adding condiments.

**Main Script:**

- Creates instances of Tea and Coffee.
- Calls the `prepare_recipe` method, which follows the algorithm defined in the abstract class but uses the specific implementations of `brew` and `add_condiments` from the concrete classes.

**Benefits of the Template Method Pattern**

- Code Reusability: Common code is implemented in the abstract class, reducing duplication.
- Flexibility: Subclasses can implement or override specific steps of the algorithm.
- Maintainability: Changes to the common algorithm structure need to be made only in the abstract class.

This pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple classes that share a common structure but differ in specific steps. By using the Template Method Pattern, you can ensure that the overall algorithm remains consistent while allowing flexibility in individual steps.
